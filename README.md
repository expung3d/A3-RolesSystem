# Roles System - Designed for Public Zeus
**Z.A.M.'s Roles System (RS)** was designed to incentivize teamplay and coordination between those in groups. You will be (practically) forced to join a group with others as if you are alone in your group you will be forced as a ‘Recruit’ role which has poor weaponry, no access to the arsenal, and limited ammo. You can change your role by joining a group with at least one other person and pressing **Ctrl + 8**.

## Roles Breakdown

Roles are broken down into categories of specialness: **basic, specialist, and support**. Specialist and support roles are limited, because of this you and your squad should choose wisely which roles are selected and when.  
  
A maximum of any combination of 2 specialist roles are allowed per squad.  
A maximum of 1 support role is allowed per squad.  
A maximum of 2 medics are allowed per squad.  
There can only be 1 squad leader per squad. (Obviously…)  
  
For quick reference, see the chart below:  

### Roles Breakdown: Role Availability Breakdown Chart
| Category: | Roles: | Unlocked at X number of squad members: | Maximum per squad: |
|--|--|--|--|
| Basic | Rifleman, Medic, Crewman, Heli Pilot, Pilot, and Squad Leader | 2 | Medic: 2; Squad Leader: 1; Total: Infinite |
| Specialist | Autorifleman, Light Anti-Tank, Marksman, Grenadier | 5 | Total: 2 |
| Support| Heavy Gunner, Heavy Anti-Tank, Sniper | 7 | Total: 1 |


## Role Limitations

Depending on your role you will be limited to certain equipment and weapons. You can carry extra mags for your teammates who have different roles, however, you cannot pick up their weapons. These restrictions are customizable to suit your needs for whatever mission you seek to create. See our guide on GitHub to learn more about customizing your version.  
  
In addition, if you are not a crewman or pilot role you cannot enter the respective vehicles as a crewmember. For example, a person who is not a pilot cannot operate a helicopter.

## Ground Commanders

Ground Commanders are Squad Leaders selected by the players to lead the entire side. Once voted in they will be the only ones able to speak in Global or Side channel.* Squad Leaders will need to relay their messages to the ground commander through the Command channel who will relay it to the Zeus. On top of the responsibility of relaying information to Zeus they also have access to supports that they can call in.  
  

### Ground Commanders: Calling Supports

Ground Commanders can call supports by either having visual line of sight to the target and a laser designator or by passing the grid reference to High Command. To access the supports menu, do so as you would normally by pressing 0-8 on your number bar. From here decide whether you would like to use a laser designator or grid coordinates.  
  
To call it using a laser designator, simply turn on your laser designator, look at your target and call the support you’d like to call via the menu.  
  
To call it using grid coordinates, open your map, hover over the position you want to call the support to and use the support. However, you will only be able to call a support within 2,500m of your current position or 1,500m from any alive Squad Leader.

### Ground Commanders: Assigning a Ground Commander

Ground Commanders can be manually assigned or voted in by the Zeus. The Zeus will have modules added to their modules tab to start a vote, manually assign one, or remove a side's commander. 

## Usage Instructions

Subscribe to this workshop item or download the script manually from the GitHub Releases and create a custom composition with the code in the init.  
  
Once you have done that, join a server that has scripting enabled as a Zeus and place the composition down.

# Arma 3 Roles System Version 1.0.2

## Overview

ZAM’s Roles System (RS) was designed to incentivize teamplay and coordination between those in groups together. You will be (practically) forced to join a group with others as if you are alone you will be forced as a ‘Recruit’ role which has poor weaponry, no access to the arsenal, and limited ammo. You can change your role by pressing **Ctrl + 8**.

## Roles Breakdown

Joining a group gives you access to all basic roles: Rifleman, Medic (two max), Crewman, Pilots, and Squad Leader. 
The Specialist roles are unlocked once a group has 5 members (two max): Autorifleman, Light Anti-Tank, Marksman, and Grenadier. 
The Support roles are unlocked when the group has 7 members (one max): Heavy Gunner, Heavy Anti-Tank, and Sniper. 

## Role Limitations

Depending on your role you will be limited to certain equipment and weapons. In addition, if you are not a crewman or pilot role you cannot enter the respective vehicles as a crewmember. You can carry extra mags for your teammates who have different roles, however, you cannot pick up their weapons.
